add date to comments / edit comments posts (therefore date string in table comments necessary and update the add_comment/edit_comment form to insert also a date in the table!!!)

cleanup directory (databases and schemata to be consistent) (probably same as in the section middle of todo priority below)
cleanup code in general

layout improvements of webpage in general
imrove crosslinkining within the webpage too! (i. e. useradd, users who are available, login/logout, etc...)
