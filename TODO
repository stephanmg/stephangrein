user notifications: insert smileys, date (for notification of new messages via email?) too and order message by ID && set somehow read state (use is_read table entry) -> make layout change more cool for read/unread messages ... -> probably show new messages already on login (and use jquery as it can be stylized: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/ maybe but uses iframes...)
-> fix CSS layout please ... additionally think about how one can notice the user that they have new messages (maybe via email notification since email was supplied into the database when registering was done? or via javascript?)
use TRANSACTIONS maybe => disconnect from DB savely in lib/MyApp.pm each?

add datum to comments / edit comments posts (therefore date string in table comments necessary and update the add_comment/edit_comment form to insert also a date in the table!!!) -> update last update comment 
show only 50 entries, and then make links to access more items of blog. / maybe implement the possibility to sort different the entries. lets say /Blog/entry_order/date and /Blog/entry_order/date_rev -> also we have /Blog/entry_order/50 or /Blog/entry_order/100
