periodically check for new messages if user has not logged in a certain time => send message with new emails (in auth table we need a column with DATE) => then send an email works...
peridoically check for deleted messages (status == 2) => then finally wipe them out of the database (warn possibly the users per mail before?! bad... or dont wipe at all .. think about that)

insert smileys in all remaining pages 
layout change more cool for read/unread messages (deelted messages grey / sent messages normal font)

imrove crosslinkining within the webpage and css style

optional: stylize query dialog with jquery, but this uses iframes, think about that too
optional: use TRANSACTIONS maybe => disconnect from DB savely in lib/MyApp.pm each?

cleanup code even more and directories
optional: more perl tests 

add datum to comments / edit comments posts (therefore date string in table comments necessary and update the add_comment/edit_comment form to insert also a date in the table!!!) -> update last update comment 
show only 50 entries, and then make links to access more items of blog. / maybe implement the possibility to sort different the entries. lets say /Blog/entry_order/date and /Blog/entry_order/date_rev -> also we have /Blog/entry_order/50 or /Blog/entry_order/100
